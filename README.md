## 📁 File Structure

```
password-gen/
├── index.html      # Main UI and script
├── README.md       # Documentation
```

All styling, HTML, and logic are in one file (`index.html`) for simplicity and quick learning. You can refactor this into separate CSS/JS files for scalability.

## 🔧 Customization Tips

- 💡 Change color themes or gradient styles in the CSS `body::before` block.
- 🎯 Add password strength scoring or animations.
- 📜 Expand character sets or add preset options (e.g., "secure", "memorable").
- ⚙️ Extract JavaScript into `script.js` and styles into `style.css` for production-grade separation of concerns.
